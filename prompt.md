# Retro RPG Game Development Plan

## Overview

Create a web-based RPG game with a classic GameBoy-style interface, featuring tile-based movement and turn-based battles inspired by classic Final Fantasy games, but with a modern emoji-based aesthetic.

- Clear border/bezel styling to mimic classic handheld

### Controller Panel (Bottom)

- Fixed to bottom of viewport
- D-pad on left side
  - ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ for directional controls
  - Touch/click responsive
  - Visual feedback on press
- Action buttons on right side
